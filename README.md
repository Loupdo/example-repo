Project: Fruit-Shopping SHOP

Working website:
Fruit-Shopping SHOP 
new concept for me: localstorage, sessionstorage, cache storage and cookies 

*Allow user to enter their name save it in cookie.
*Display the shop
*Allow user to add items in their cart and empty it.
*Dynamically calculate cart total
*Save cart as a JSON in localstorage
*Allow user to choose a font 
*Save their font in sessionstorage
*CSS and images are using cache storage
