Working website:
Fruit-Shopping SHOP: best selection of fruit 
new concept for me: localstorage, session storage, cache storage and cookies 

*Allow user to enter their name
*Display the shop
*Allow user to add items in their cart and empty it
*Dynamically calculate cart tota
*Allow user to choose a font
